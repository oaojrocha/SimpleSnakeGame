# snake-game

It's a simple snake game project made in JavaScript, CSS and a little of HTML.

This game was done in purpose of my personal training with JavaScript.

## Basic Information

* The way to increase your score is by 'eating' the score points, its a blue point;
* The map (matrix) is your limit, when your crash into you lose all your score;
* You can't crash into your self (the snake can't go thought itself), if you do it, it'll be game over for you;
* As much as you get more score the snake grows; ( ͡°﻿ ͜ʖ ͡°)
* You can't turn into the opposite direction, for eg.: the snake is going up, if you press down nothing will happen;

### Controls

* **Arrow UP** - Turns up
* **Arrow DOWN** - Turns down
* **Arrow LEFT** - Turns left
* **Arrow RIGHT** - Turns right
